# pollen-s-profiling-Automated-Classification-of-pollen-Grain
CNN Model to Classify Pollen Grains based on user input
Note: download the trained model and the dataset from the links in links_to_model&dataset.md file and also download the modules given below (modules used) to run the python program in your PC. Don’t forget to change the file paths of the model and the dataset in the python code(refer the links_to_model&dataset.md file) =)
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is Pollen Grain Image Classification Dataset from Kaggle. The classification of pollen species and types is an important task in many areas like forensic palynology, archaeological palynology and melissopalynology. This is the first annotated image dataset for the Brazilian Savannah pollen types that can be used to train and test computer vision based automatic pollen classifiers.

The dataset has a total of 790 pollen grain images (.jpg files) containing 23 classes of pollen grains. The entire file size of the dataset is 32.85 MB with images of around 300x300 resolution. It has a usability of 8.8 and gives a good accuracy with CNN’s.
